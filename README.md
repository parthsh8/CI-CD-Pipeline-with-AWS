# CI-CD-Pipeline-with-AWS

This Project is used to get knowledge of CI/CD Pipeline using AWS.
Here I have used different servies of AWS such as IAM, S3, EC2, CloudCommit, CloudBuild, CloudDeploy, Pipeline
buildspec file is configuration file required for building from the repo from the CodeCommit
Artifact will be created after building from CodeCommit
Artifact file will be stored in S3  
appspec file will be used as configuration for CodeDeploy
